# scan-to-ebook
_Various scripts to transform scans into (basic) e-books easily_

## Why?
This project originated with the need to turn a paper book into an e-book: a bike travel guide by Esterbauer Verlag, in the bikeline series, that is not available in any electronic format.

Several points had to be met for this:
- make it as light (in bytes) as possible to avoid bloating the e-reader's limited storage capacity,
- keep an appropriate resolution to make it both readable and not too slow on an e-reader,
- add an OCR layer to make it searchable,
- use as much as possible existing tools to keep code maintenance low.

## Future and contributions
It may include other scripts as time passes. Feel free to contribute yours!
